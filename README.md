# Virtual-Real-Integration

This repository is for exploration of use cases for Real/Virtual World integration. The first use case, "Assisted Car-Human Urban Rendezvous" will appear in first draft form approximately 21 November. Please raise issues reflecting your needs, opinions, ideas. A full draft ontology of "Assisted Car-Human Urban Rendezvous" and a kickoff mapping of James Jackson's building blocks should be in place not later than our next meeting and hopefully before.
