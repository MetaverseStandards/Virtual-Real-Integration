# Virtual-Real-Integration

This repository is for exploration of use cases for Real/Virtual World integration. 
The first use case, "Assisted Car-Human Urban Rendezvous" will appear in first draft form approximately 24 November. Please raise issues reflecting your needs, opinions, ideas. 

A full first draft ontology of "Assisted Car-Human Urban Rendezvous" including a mapping of James Jackson's building blocks should be in place not later than our Dec 1 online meeting and hopefully before. My plan is to get a coherent first draft in place and then to develop it collaboratively between meetings so that we can focus on things that need discussion or decisions in the online meetings. I will work as fast as I can to get this first draft in place, following the general ideas of the shared ride arriving for a passenger pickup that we have talked about off and on in the meetings.
