# Use cases summarized from Real/Virtual Exploratory Group meetings

**Reality Enablers** are infrastucture that enables **Reality Players** to function in a mixed reality environment. Extracting services from use cases and matching to Building Blocks is a starting point.

**Reality Players** each have a standardized method (standardised interfaces?) to connect with James Jackson Building Blocks â€“ implementation may vary.

## Eleven Use Cases:

- Use Case 1 (UC1): "Assisted Car-Human Urban Rendezvou" [Shared ride car id virtual tag (floating sign) rendezvous with person]
- Use Case 2 (UC2): "Read the Street" [AR for undergound utilities]
- Use Case 3 (UC3): A person working and moving in a real-world environment [food service department, campus, power or communications control panel] where technical information [user manuals, schematics, valve or switch usage, diagnostic procedure, analysis, part ordering] is virtually available in connection with specific pieces of equipment and the person's role as a technician.
- Use Case 4 (UC4): A person walks through a campus and can virtually access useful information about built objects in their surroundings. 
- Use Case 5 (UC5): A ship employs a pilot for a precision approach to a pier in a busy harbor.
- Use Case 6 (UC6): People meet in a room.
- Use Case 7 (UC7): A person visits a virtual art gallery embedded in the real world: [Google commercial](https://www.ispot.tv/ad/2GCE/google-shop-puffer-jackets-song-by-ariana-grande) 
- Use Case 8 (UC8): Access to building for proprietary purpose.

**Shared Services** are mostly (entirely - by definition?) functionality that is used by other (non V/R integration) aspects.
