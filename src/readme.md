# Use cases summarized from Real/Virtual Exploratory Group meetings

**Reality Enablers** are infrastucture that enables **Reality Players** to function in a mixed reality environment. Extracting services from use cases and matching to Building Blocks is a starting point.

**Reality Players** each have a standardized method (standardised interfaces?) to connect with James Jackson Building Blocks â€“ implementation may vary.

## Use Case List:

- Use Case 1 (UC1): Shared ride car id tag rendezvous with person
- Ship pilot approach pier
- Walking around campus
- Meeting in a room
- Visit to a virtual art gallery embedded in the real world
- Access to building for proprietary purpose
- Police investigation
- Menu appropriate restaurant where you are sitting
- Layered content with different access rights and experiences e.g. buried utilities
- "Read the street" AR for undergound utilities

**Shared Services** are mostly (entirely - by definition?) functionality that is used by other (non V/R integration) aspects.
